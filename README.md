# OVOS How Are Things Skill

Perform simple system/network checks 

## About

Learning Python and OVOS Skill development.  This is a simple OVOS Skill that runs a few Raspberry PI system commands 
and reports on the heath of the system - initially Temp, CPU load, Disk usage and throttling history.

It is also contains a few python/skill development tests (a playland for me)
- WHAT:  WhatAreYouDoing (intent & dialog) 
- WHO DA MAN:  Intent and dialog

## Examples

- "How are things"
- "How are you (doing?)"
- "How's everything (going)?"
- "How are you feeling?"
